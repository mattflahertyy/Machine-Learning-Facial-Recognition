Training log:

The following training models were ran in order

Iteration #1
Model 1:
Used learning rate of 0.001, best Val Loss: 1.3440
Best epoch: 7

Iteration #2
Model 2:
Changed learning rate to 0.0001, best Val Loss: 1.1349, results were more accurate
But for this we didnt do max pool after every layer or input size, will redo it at the end
Best epoch: 7

Iteration #3
Model 3:
Just to test the horizontal flipping and rotation, results were worse
Used learning rate of 0.0001, horizontal flipping and random rotation best Val Loss: 1.2546
Best epoch: 3

Iteration #4
Variant 1:
Used learning rate of 0.0001, 5 layers kernel 5x5 best Val Loss: 0.9997, best results overall
Best epoch: 8

Iteration #5
Variant 2:
Used learning rate of 0.0001, 3 layers kernel 2x2 best Val Loss: 1.1104, slightly worse results than final regular model
Best epoch: 4

Iteration #6
Final model (regular):
Used learning rate of 0.0001, best Val Loss: 1.0704
Added the max pooling and input size to be consistent with the variants
Best epoch: 5
